# Eclipse Tech Grid

Ever played Eclipse? If yes, then you know one of the few downfalls of the
game's design is the isolated location of the available techs. This grid lets
players track the available techs from a screen, (like your TV). 


## Use
Left click a tech to add one to the stack.
Right click a stack to remove.
Don't reload the page because it doesn't cache it's state (yet...?).
